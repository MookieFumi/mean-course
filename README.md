# Stack Mean Course

MEAN refers to first letters of the four components of a free and open-source solution stack for building dynamic web sites. MEAN is a full-stack JavaScript platform designed for web applications. Valeri Karpov was a MongoDB developer at that time, who coined the MEAN stack term, and tells about it in one of his blog posts. The components of the MEAN stack are as follows:

* **MongoDB**
a NoSQL database

* **Express.js**
a web applications framework

* **Angular.js**
a JavaScript MVC framework for web apps

* **Node.js**
a software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications
